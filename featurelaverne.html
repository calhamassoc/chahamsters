	<td colspan=20 rowspan=1 width=696><span style="font-size:14">I went into a pet shop to sell some of my young hamsters.&nbsp; I started looking around the shop when the sales person drew my attention to a pair of young Syrians that were huddled together in a rather small area.&nbsp; Something didn't seem right.&nbsp; The sales person opened the cage.&nbsp; He easily lifted Shirley out and handed her to me.&nbsp; I thought Shirley might have been dropped and had a back injury.&nbsp; When Linda her, she thought that it could possibly be a stroke.. She has minimal movement on her left side and rolls on her side when she tries to walk.&nbsp; Her sister was taking care of her, making sure she ate and drank.&nbsp; Being a retired RN, I simply could not leave the girls behind.&nbsp; The store gladly gave them to me.<br><br>I put them in a large plastic cage so Shirley couldn't get hurt on it.&nbsp; She desparately needed rehab so I bought toys she would have to climb under and through.&nbsp; Laverne would go though first and then wait on the sidelines for Shirley to tackle it.&nbsp; Shirley is much improved.&nbsp; She is more stable in her mobility and has become more agile.&nbsp; Soon I will separate Laverne from Shirley.&nbsp; Laverne needs her own life too.&nbsp; I am so glad I brought them home with me.&nbsp; It has been a rewarding experience for my husband Ken and I.</span></td>
