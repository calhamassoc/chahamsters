One of mine used to spend 10 - 20 minutes or so scratching madly at the bubble end cap of the tubing and another hamster used to scratch at the bottom of her plastic sand potty, much like a dog digging for bones. They would do this daily for several days then stop, at which time I suppose they felt their nails were trimmed nicely!<br> <br>Let's look at what's considered &quot;too long&quot; and some problems it may cause:</span></td>

	<td colspan=28 rowspan=2 width=692><span style="font-size:14">Trimming hamster nails is easier said than done.&nbsp; You will need plenty of patience.&nbsp; It might take several days before you get the hang of it, and it may take just as long to succeed in trimming just one nail!&nbsp; Sometimes the nail trimming goes smoothly for some reason, letting you get several nails done.&nbsp; Then there are those other times, when the hamster is just too squirmy and you have to try again on another day.<br> <br>Good lighting helps immensely.&nbsp; To help you see more detail, you might try investing in a pair of magnifying reading glasses for this job (sold at most drugstores or borrow from grandma or grandpa).<br> <br>Once you've got the clipper on the CORRECT PART of the nail, hold your hamster's arm gently yet firmly (if that is the technique you are using), and clip the nail decisively. If you falter, you might end up with a hangnail or a ragged edge which may be worse than if you had not clipped the nail in the first place.<br> <br>Try to clip the longest nails first. That way, if you only get one nail for that day, at least the most offensive nail is taken care of.<br> <br>Always err on the side of clipping less (especially if you're new at this).&nbsp; If it's still too long, you can always trim again on your next round.&nbsp; NEVER cut too much, you'll hurt the hamster and leave their nail area prone to infection.&nbsp; However, if you should accidentally clip the nail too short and it bleeds, have some styptic powder on hand to dab on the area - this should quickly stop the bleeding.&nbsp; In the very unlikely event it doesn't stop, give your vet a call for advice.&nbsp; Styptic powder is available from the vets or at pet shops, and is inexpensive.<br> <br>Once clipped, you needn't worry about clipping for a month or more, when you start noticing the nails getting too long again.&nbsp; However, it's still important to check their nails when you conduct your daily routine inspection of your hamster's overall health.&nbsp; You might notice, for example, elderly hamsters who have never needed nail trims before, growing longer nails due to their reduced activity level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you might find one nail growing much faster than the rest.&nbsp; Also check for any breakage, tearing or soreness.</span></td>
