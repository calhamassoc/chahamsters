	<td><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Where can I buy a hamster?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> It is better to buy a hamster from a breeder than a pet store.&nbsp; This way you have a greater chance of finding a hamster who has been handled and is disease free.&nbsp; Breeders can also give you a lot of info on caring for your hamster.&nbsp; Plus you can often see the parents and learn about their pedigree and color which is fun.<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  What kind of hamster is the best pet?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> This is a personal decision and will differ for different people.&nbsp; Dwarf hamsters are not good for younger children (under about 8) since they tend to be perpetual motion.&nbsp; They don’t sit still, and younger children tend to squeeze them too hard.&nbsp; They can be quite entertaining and fun, though, and often wake and play during the day as well as the night.&nbsp; Syrians, on the other hand, can be grumpy during the day although they do move slower and are easier for children to handle.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  What species is a “teddy bear?”&nbsp; What species is a “black bear?”<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> A “teddy bear” is a syrian hamster.&nbsp; The term “teddy bear” is most commonly used to describe the long haired syrians.&nbsp; They are native to the country of Syria.&nbsp;&nbsp; “Black bear” is also the nickname for a syrian.&nbsp; Obviously it was targeted at the black syrians.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Why are my two syrians fighting?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> Syrians are solitary hamsters and need to be kept one to a cage from the age of 8 weeks.&nbsp; Fighting usually occurs and often results in death if two syrians are kept in a cage.&nbsp; It’s just not worth the risk.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Can my dwarf hamsters live together?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Dwarf hamsters will generally live peacefully in same sex or mixed sex pairs.&nbsp; On occasion, fighting will occur and they will need to be separated.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> Can they eat fruits and vegetables?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Yes.&nbsp; Hamsters like most fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; It’s best to stay away from citrus fruits, lettuce and strong foods like onions and garlic.&nbsp; In particular, hamsters like apples, cantaloupe, broccoli, zucchini, etc.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  What should I feed my hamster?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> You should always stay with mixes prepared for hamsters.&nbsp; Many people use lab blocks although most prepared mixes are also good for hamsters – as long as they are not allowed to only eat their favorite portions of the mixes.&nbsp; Store-bought treats and other foods (like dog food or cereal) should be only used as treats and not as a steady part of their diet.&nbsp; It is best to use fruits and veggies as their main treat – and they love them.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  What bedding should I use?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> Carefresh is a favorite among pet owners.&nbsp; Aspen is also popular but harder to find.&nbsp; Cedar should never be used since hamsters are allergic and cannot tolerate the oils in it.&nbsp; Pine has the same oils to a lesser extent and should not be used either.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  What kind of cage should I get?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> There are advantages and disadvantages to all cages.&nbsp; Glass aquariums tend to be cheap and easy to clean but are heavy.&nbsp; Plastic aquarium-like cages are cheap, easy, and light to clean but can be hard to find in larger sizes.&nbsp; Wire cages tend to be better for syrians (dwarves tend to escape) but are often messy due to shavings spilling out.&nbsp; Additionally, they should be kept out of areas with drafts.&nbsp; Fancy plastic tube cages are fun and pleasing to the eyes but are expensive and tend to be very time consuming to clean.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  What toys are best?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Wood toys are hard to sanitize and should be used sparingly.&nbsp; Plastic or disposable toys tend to be best.&nbsp; Disposable toys include toilet paper rolls (with a few unscented white sheets left on) and empty boxes.&nbsp; Plastic houses and toys are best if there is no bottom to them.&nbsp; Far too many kids shake a hamster out of a toy or tube, so I always encourage houses and toys without a bottom.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  How do I stop the wheel from squeaking?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Use any edible oil such as crisco, olive oil, vaseline, etc.&nbsp; It may need to be re-applied regularly.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> Why does my hamster sleep all day?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Hamsters are noctural and naturally sleep during the day.&nbsp; They are most active at night.&nbsp; Syrian hamsters in particular tend to be heavy day sleepers.&nbsp; It is always best to play with hamsters either early in the morning or late at night.<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Can I enter my pet store hamster in a show?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> Yes.&nbsp; You can enter a pet store hamster in a show.&nbsp; He may or may not be show quality as far as the standards go.&nbsp; You can only find that out by bringing him to a show and getting the judge’s opinion.&nbsp; Even if he is not show quality according to the standards, you can always enter your hamster in the pet class.&nbsp; Hamsters can also be entered in both classes – even at the same show.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  Why should I come to a hamster show?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A </span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"> Some people come for the fun of competition.&nbsp; Others come to learn more about hamsters and to talk to other hamster owners.&nbsp; One of the best places to get correct and useful info on hamsters is from other owners and breeders at a show.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Q</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  How can I tell if my hamster is pregnant?<br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">A</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14">  There is no reliable way to tell if your hamster is pregnant.&nbsp; It is usually best to wait through the short gestation and see if any babies are born although usually the nipples become more red and prominent within 36 hours of conception.&nbsp; For syrians, the gestation is 16 days.&nbsp; For dwarf hamsters, the gestation is 18-21 days.</span></td>
