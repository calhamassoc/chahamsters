If you are buying a syrian, make sure you buy one cage per Syrian.&nbsp; Regardless of what anyone tells you, all syrians must live alone after the age of 8 weeks.<br><br>There are four commonly kept Dwarf hamsters.&nbsp; The different species typically live in Central Asia, Russia, Mongolia, China, and neighboring regions.<br><br>The most common and popular Dwarf Hamster in California is the Campbells Dwarf hamster.&nbsp; They come in a large variety of colors including black, albino, blue, and chocolate.&nbsp; They are often also called the Russian Dwarf hamster.<br><br>One might also see the Winter White Dwarf hamster in pet stores in California (and they are often seen at shows).&nbsp; These hamsters have a summer and a winter coat.&nbsp; The summer coat is fairly dark with various shades of black and brown.&nbsp; The winter coat is mostly white.&nbsp; As the hours of sunlight decrease, the hamster lightens into its winter coat as a camouflage in the snow.&nbsp; When the hours of sunlight again increase, they change back into their summer coat.<br><br>The Roborovski Dwarf hamster is not commonly found.&nbsp; It is the smallest of the Dwarf hamsters and does not typically make a good pet due to its small size and speed.&nbsp; They are very active and difficult to handle.<br><br>The fourth type of Dwarf hamster commonly kept in the US is illegal in California.&nbsp; Thus, you will not see them at shows or in the pet stores.&nbsp; The Chinese typically come in a sandy brown color and are easily distinguished by their longer tail (longer than a typical hamster but shorter than a mouse).<br><br></span></font><b><font face="Helvetica"><span style="font-size:14">Buying a Pet Hamster</span></font></b><font face="Helvetica"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>It is best to buy your hamster from a show or hobby breeder.&nbsp; These breeders typically take more care in arranging complimentary pairs and use higher quality supplies for their animals.&nbsp; Usually the health and temperament are better, too, as well as the hamster is less stressed than in the pet store environment.<br><br>If you must buy from a pet store, your first impression when walking in the store is very important.&nbsp; Make sure it is clean and tidy.&nbsp; Ask to handle the hamsters.&nbsp; Make sure the clerk is comfortable putting his hand in the cage to ensure well socialized animals.&nbsp; One of the key indicators of health is the eyes.&nbsp; Check to see that the eyes are clear and alert.&nbsp; Check the animal for wounds.&nbsp; If the clerk knows how to sex hamsters, ensure that all animals in the cage are of the same sex.&nbsp; And for Syrians, always check as many syrians as you can for wet tail.&nbsp; The key symptom is diarrhea, and if any hamster in any cage has it, leave the store immediately and go to another store.&nbsp; Always feel free to walk out of a store if you have any concerns.&nbsp; It is better to be safe than purchase a sick or mean hamster.<br><br><br></span></font><b><font face="Helvetica"><span style="font-size:14">Hamster Care</span></font></b><font face="Helvetica"><span style="font-size:14"><br><br>1. Cage.&nbsp; Make sure the cage is large enough for the adult size of your species.&nbsp; Wheels are often too small for adult Syrians and must be replaced.&nbsp; Each kind of cage has its advantages and disadvantages, so choose the one which best meets your needs.&nbsp; Generally the larger the better.<br><br>Make sure to include a wheel in the cage.&nbsp; There must also be a constant source of fresh water.&nbsp; Always choose a gravity fed water bottle over a water bowl for cleanliness and sanitation reasons.&nbsp; A food dish is nice although many hamsters will store the food elsewhere in their cage.&nbsp; A house is also appreciated by the hamster.&nbsp; Make sure the house and all other toys can be easily cleaned and sanitized and the openings are sufficiently large for your hamster when full grown.<br><br>2. Supplies.&nbsp; Avoid cedar beddings.&nbsp; Cedar has oils which can harm your hamster’s respiratory system.&nbsp; Concerns have been raised about both pine and aspen for hamsters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carefresh seems to be safe for hamsters although there are many other good beddings on the market also.<br><br>Choose a quality hamster mix or preferably a rodent lab block (also sold as rodent chow or rodent diet).&nbsp; The lab blocks are scientifically prepared as a balanced diet for rodents and come in a pelleted form.&nbsp; Hamsters do not typically overeat.&nbsp; They will store excess food in a corner and save it for later.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they can get fat if feed an improper diet. Avoid the store bought treats (not nutritious and overly expensive) and rely on small portions fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Your hamster’s health will be better, and he will be perfectly happy with fruit or veggies as his treat.&nbsp; Avoid citrus fruits, lettuce, and other strong items like garlic or onions.&nbsp; Target items such as apples, broccoli, strawberries, and zucchini.&nbsp; Introduce your hamster gradually to fruits and vegetables to avoid diarrhea.<br><br>3. Cleaning.&nbsp; Cages should be thoroughly cleaned once a week unless there are babies.&nbsp; Fresh fruits and vegetables should be removed 24 hours after feeding if not consumed to avoid spoilage when placed in the food stash.&nbsp; At each cleaning, you should thoroughly check your hamster’s health.&nbsp; If there is anything suspicious, seek veterinary assistance.<br><br>Hamsters do not need baths and can get sick from the chill.&nbsp; They will clean and groom themselves regularly.&nbsp; Many hamsters appreciate a dust bath, though, from time to time.&nbsp; A sanitary and fine dust such as chinchilla dust is good for this purpose and can be put in a small bowl for them to roll in.<br><br>4. Taming.&nbsp; Many hamsters need taming (see taming brochure).&nbsp; If bred well, though, the taming process does not take long and your hamster will remain tame with consistent handling.&nbsp; With most hamsters, the taming process is a matter of talking to your hamster in a soothing voice and using slow and gentle movements.&nbsp; Make sure you always handle your hamster close to the ground (preferably sitting on the carpet) during the taming process to avoid falls.&nbsp; Even after the hamster is tamed, he should be handled while you are sitting down and not carried around or placed on a shoulder while walking around.<br><br>Remember that a hamster will bite if startled or frightened and can easily draw blood.&nbsp; Do not grab a hamster when it is asleep.&nbsp; Make sure he is awake and ready to be handled.&nbsp; And don’t handle the hamster when around large groups of people or loud noises.&nbsp; They have a very good sense of hearing and can be adversely impacted.<br><br>Along the same lines, hamsters do not have good eyesight.&nbsp; They can easily fall from tables or couches possibly injuring themselves.&nbsp; Make sure to keep them secure.&nbsp; Hamsters should never run around loose on the floor since they can easily get lost or stepped on.&nbsp; Try using a hamster ball instead, but make sure the hamster is supervised and returned to his cage every 20-30 minutes for a break.<br><br>5. Health.&nbsp; Hamsters are generally healthy animals.&nbsp; They can and do, however, get sick.&nbsp; As soon as you bring home your hamster, call the veterinarians in your area to locate a good small animal vet (often called an exotics vet).&nbsp; This will help you in case of an emergency.<br><br>Once you notice that your hamster is ill, do not delay getting him into the vet.&nbsp; Hamster illnesses progress rapidly, and quick action on your part is essential.</span></font></td>
