so, how long should she have to run around in it?<br><br></span><font size="+2"><span style="font-size:24">A </span></font><span style="font-size:14">People are of two minds, I'm seeing, about play balls. I 
like them, and my advice is simple:
<br>
<br>1. About twenty minutes at a time, thirty's not dangerous.
<br>
<br>2. A bit of tape on the lid a MUST.
&nbsp; What we do is buy a bunch of cheap packing tape from 
an office supply store and put a long, wide strip across the lid and onto the 
sides. It makes the hatch quite unbreachable. Hams concentrate their 
life's ambitions into very few things, and escaping play balls by 
chewing the hatch tabs is one of them.<br>
<br>3. Block off stairwells, etc., as well as areas that will 
give trouble, such as where a bare floor meets a rug - they can't 
get the traction to get over that, so once they go off the edge of 
the rug, they're stuck.
<br>
<br>4. Don't allow contact with electrical wires, they can 
often bite through the vents.
<br>
<br>5. Wash ball after every use (it inspires them to poo and pee a LOT).
<br>
<br>My wife used to like them, but lately she represents the 
other camp, which is suggesting that hams really don't enjoy the 
experience that much, but they just roll around because they are 
really looking for a way out.
<br>
<br>I don't agree with her. I have found, and I'm resolute 
about this, that most hams go about gleefully (to my hamster-sense), 
and the few I've known who DON'T like the experience just stop in 
their tracks, curl up, sulk a bit, and wait it out.
<br>
<br>I say go for it.
