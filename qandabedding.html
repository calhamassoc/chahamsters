	<td><span style="font-size:14">In the past, I have typically used Aspen shavings.&nbsp; Due the sensitivities of some of my animals, though, I have switched away from aspen.&nbsp; They have the largest flakes of shaved wood, but they also have smaller pieces mixed in.&nbsp; The smaller pieces generally fall to the bottom of the cage while the larger ones are gathered by the hamsters to make their nest.<br><br>Shredded Aspen tends to have small but long pieces of wood.&nbsp; The hamsters can make nice, formed nests from shredded Aspen.&nbsp; Some packages of Aspen seem to have very stringy pieces of wood which could entangle a hamster limb.&nbsp; I do find that my winter whites in particular like to take my Aspen shavings and shred them so that they almost look like shredded Aspen.&nbsp; They are more prone to creating burrows and sleeping entirely under the shavings, and it appears that shredding it makes them better able to create their &quot;structures&quot; and build little tunnels.<br><br>The Aspen Sani-chips are not as easy to find as the other forms of Aspen.&nbsp; Some of the local clubs here use it in their show boxes during shows.&nbsp; It makes a nice, flat flooring covering for easy animal viewing.&nbsp; The hamsters generally cannot burrow under it nor make much of a nest with it.&nbsp; Those who have used it as a main bedding say that it seems to find its way into every crack and crevice in their house.</span></td>

	<td><span style="font-size:14">Carefresh is also a very popular bedding in California.&nbsp; It is a paper pulp product and generally comes in the gray color.&nbsp; The company does offer Ultra Carefresh which is white, but it is not readily available.&nbsp; It is also more expensive than the regular Carefresh.<br><br>Those who use Carefresh say that it's generally more absorbent.&nbsp; Cages need to be cleaned less frequently, and spot cleaning is quite easy.&nbsp; Some colors of hamsters are less visible on this bedding, but the lighter colored hamsters are obviously more visible.&nbsp; Carefresh does tend to be more costly per cage cleaning, and you can mix Carefresh with one of the Aspen beddings.<br><br>Pine Shavings are included to the right of this picture.&nbsp; In the past, Pine has been the most available and the cheapest bedding.&nbsp; Few fanciers will use it anymore, though, due to the fact that recent research indicates that it is less healthy for rodents.&nbsp; It is still readily available in pet stores and will often have pictures of rodents on the packaging.&nbsp; Until further research is done on the effect of Pine on hamsters, it's unsure how safe it is.</span></td>
