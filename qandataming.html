It had been on cedar shavings.&nbsp; The mother complained that the eye was sometimes closed, and I noticed some missing fur around the eye.&nbsp; I had seen these symptoms before from cedar shavings.&nbsp; In this case the hamster had been switched from aspen, the least irritating wood shaving, to cedar, the most irritating wood shaving on the market.&nbsp; With cedar, the skin often gets red and irritated as well as itchy.&nbsp; This is bound to make any hamster irritable and cranky.<br><br>2. The hamster was having to walk and sleep on a wire cage bottom.&nbsp; She had purchased an expensive cage and assumed they knew what they were doing with the wire cage bottom.&nbsp; This poor hamster had a little nest in one little corner and wire everywhere she walked.&nbsp; With each step, she had to watch her footing or fall through.&nbsp; I did not see open sores on her feet and shins as I have seen from wire wheels, but clearly not being able to walk anywhere within the cage without hurting her feet would irritate any hamster.<br><br>3. The mother was giving her toilet paper to make a nest.&nbsp; Each night she removed the toilet paper and gave her new toilet paper.&nbsp; Each night the hamster had to re-make her nest.&nbsp; I suspect this was stressful and irritating to the poor hamster – especially since she had to do it while walking on wire.&nbsp; The mother did say the hamster put a lot of work into building her nest every night.&nbsp; She claimed that she removed it since it smelled.<br><br>So taming an irritable and cranky hamster may involve more than the hamster itself.&nbsp; It can involve the environment in which the hamster lives.&nbsp; This hamster was and is again a very friendly hamster.&nbsp; When put in an improper environment, though, she became a &quot;nasty beast.&quot;&nbsp; Evaluate the environment your hamster is in.&nbsp; Try to think like a hamster and eliminate any irritants or stressors.&nbsp; This will aid in creating a friendly and well-adjusted hamster.</span></td>
