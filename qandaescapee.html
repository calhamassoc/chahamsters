	<td><span style="font-size:14">The question repeatedly comes up: How do I catch my AWOL hamster?<br><br>Most of the following suggestions are oldies but goodies, but they are successful.<br><br>Before getting to the information on &quot;trapping,&quot; first take a brief survey of the room where the hamster escaped from. Seal off doors and closets with a towel, remove any cats or dogs from the area (and if<br>possible, keep them outside). Survey the floor for poop and/or seed trails, and check under furniture. Call to your little Houdini in your familiar hammie call, and offer a treat.<br><br>For some odd reason that only hammies understand, they love kitchens and bathrooms. They can often be found behind a stove, refrigerator, or toilet. Floor level heating vents are another popular vacation spot.&nbsp; Once you've done the survey, try any and all of the following:<br><br>Place the hamster cage on the floor, door open, with fresh food inside.&nbsp; The theory is that once they are tired of wandering, they want to go home. Check the cage frequently. You can make a trail of food leading to the cage (and it helps to have previously &quot;trained&quot; your hamster to come to the sound of a noisy treat, like a box of cheerios, or yogurt drops.&nbsp; The sound of the box being shaken and the treats left out may lure them in). A variation on this is to add crinkled newspaper around the cage area, so you can hear any little paws walking on the paper. Put a wheel near the cage and listen for squeaks.<br><br>The bucket trick is another popular lure. Use a clean, small bucket and add a ladder of books or something (maybe covered with a towel for traction) to enable the hammie to climb up the side (providing a trail of food around the bucket). Put treats inside the bucket (they can smell a dab of peanut butter from anywhere within the house!). Hammie climbs in for the treats, and you’ll find him curled in a ball sound asleep the next morning. An interesting addition to this is to use some tubing from the hamster cage, if available, and let them into the bucket through tubes.</span></td>

	<td><span style="font-size:14">f your hamster has a friend or mate at home, take the mate out and play -- jealousy and the desire for treats may make an impression, as may raging hormones. You may also spot the escapee during the nightly zoomer ball travels of the other hamsters.<br><br>Humane traps are not suggested. They are not intended for pets, and the dangers of use for a hamster outweigh the potential benefits. If you have more than one level in your home, set up a &quot;hamster catcher&quot; on each level. Try to stay awake as late as possible, when the hamster is more likely to be active and roaming.<br><br>And don't give up. One hamster was recovered in an apartment one floor below where he lived, three months after the escape, dirty, hungry and dehydrated, but able to make a full recovery. A little observation of how your hamster uses the cage may give you some insight into possible escape routes before they occur. My husband and I no longer say goodnight to each other. Our last words before falling asleep at night are &quot;Did you make sure to lock the cage?&quot;</span></td>
