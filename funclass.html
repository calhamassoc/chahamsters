	<td><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">The fun classes will be judged at the judge’s discretion and are generally subjective categories.&nbsp; Here are some possible interpretations for the classes.&nbsp; Remember that an individual judge might use different criteria.<br><br>1. Biggest<br>This will usually go to a hamster who is fit and large.&nbsp; The hamster will generally be both long and stocky although different judges will weight length and breadth differently.<br><br>2. Cutest<br>This is entirely subjective and depends on the tastes of the judge that day.<br><br>3. Best Eyes and Ears<br>The winner in this category will generally have clear and bold eyes and ears which stand out when the hamster is looked at in its entirety.&nbsp; Biggest is not necessarily best particularly if the eyes are bulging or the ears are too large in proportion to the body.<br><br>4. Fastest in the Ball<br>This is the most objective class.&nbsp; The winner will be the hamster who crosses the finish line first.<br><br>5.&nbsp; Longest Fur (syrians only)<br>This class is only for syrians and will generally go to the male syrian who has the longest coat.&nbsp; The judge can decide how he/she measures it including whether or not he/she wants to judge the longest tuft or prefers the average length of the entire coat.<br><br>6.&nbsp; Mellowest<br>This hamster will generally be the most easy going and handleable hamster.<br><br>7. Best Personality<br>This is a subjective class based on what characteristics the judge deems desirable in a hamster.&nbsp; These could include things such as curiosity, handleability, gentleness, etc.<br><br>8.&nbsp; Best Matched Pair<br>This award will go to the two hamsters who, in the judge’s opinion, look most alike in color, size, pattern, etc.<br><br>9. Best Stripe (dwarves only)<br>This class is for dwarves only and will go to the dwarf hamster who has the best stripe.&nbsp; Criteria which the judge may analyze include the completeness of the stripe and the straightness of the stripe.<br><br>10. Most Unusual Color and/or Markings<br>This award will go the hamster who, in the judge’s opinion, has the most unusual color and/or markings.<br><br>We welcome ideas that you have for additional Fun Classes.&nbsp; We will analyze them and see if they meet the characteristics of the animals shown at CHA shows.<br><br>Note:&nbsp; Remember that not all Fun Classes are available at all shows.&nbsp; Please see our </span></font><a href="calendar.html"><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Event Calendar</span></font></a><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"> to see which Fun Classes are offered at a particular show.</span></font></td>
