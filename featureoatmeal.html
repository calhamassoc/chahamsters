	<td><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Hi, my name is Oatmeal !</span></font><span style="font-size:14"><br><br></span><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">I was brought to an animal shelter in August 2001; my owner had too many hamsters. When I was brought in, I was about six weeks old. The shelter is very big (THS) and I was in quarantine for a while. Once I got into the adoption area, there were rabbits, gerbils, and cats in my area of the shelter.&nbsp; The shelter takes in animals for a city of about 3,000,000 people.<br><br>I was there for a long time.&nbsp; My life is short but I spent months in the shelter. I am nocturnal and had to deal with lots of strange people in the daytime. I was very scared. <br><br>After a while, my picture was posted on petfinder.com.&nbsp; It was not a good likeness, as I was sleepy. My cage was small, my home / nest was too small and I had no wheel. The shelter tried to help but has its limitations.<br><br>Some hammie lovers saw my picture.<br><br>Marlene and Mike contacted the shelter, and confirmed I was safe and still there. They came and saw me on November 16, 2001 in my cage.&nbsp; They seemed like nice people and they smelled like hammies and good foods, so I let them take me to their home. The cage they brought to put me in was really big, bigger than my home in the shelter.<br><br>I heard something about &quot;paper work,&quot; don't know what that means, but I love to shred toilet paper for nesting material.<br><br>I am really scared of people.&nbsp; I saw thousands in the shelter, but these people smell good. They give me food and let me go into a &quot;ball.&quot; I think I like it here. I am slowly starting to be friends with these humans, but I am still nervous.<br><br>I don't run and hide any more, and I come out into the ball in the evening with Marlene, and now in the early morning with Mike. I have lots of fun running around with the other hammies in our balls.<br><br>I love my life here!<br><br>Oatmeal</span></font></td>
