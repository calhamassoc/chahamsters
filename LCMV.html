	<td><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">The primary concern with any rodent and pregnancy is LCMV (Lymphocytic Choriomengingitis Virus) or Viral Meningitis.&nbsp; Mice, Rats, Hamsters, and other rodents can pass this to humans and other animals. <br><br>LCMV is usually not fatal to adult humans.&nbsp; In fact, most cases are so mild they go vastly unreported.&nbsp; The mortality rate is about 1%. It's thought that about 2 to 10 percent of the human population have already contracted and recovered from LCMV based on serological (blood work) studies conducted in urban areas of the US.&nbsp; The symptoms are very much like a cold or flu.<br><br>The first stage of the virus typically begins with fever, malaise, anorexia, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting.&nbsp; Other symptoms that appear less frequently include sore throat, cough, joint pain, chest pain, testicular pain, and parotid (salivary gland) pain.&nbsp; Most cases do not proceed to a second stage but a few days after the first stage passes, the victim may develop a fever, headache, and a stiff neck.&nbsp; There are other more acute and sometimes fatal symptoms that can develop at the same time; these are not common. <br><br>The above are the symptoms and concerns for non-pregnant humans.&nbsp; However when a woman is pregnant a whole new set of problems arise should she become infected.&nbsp; LCMV is one of the few viruses that can pass the placental barrier.&nbsp; A fetus that get LCMV is commonly born with severe birth defects or may even die. <br><br>Before you all panic, realize that with one or two hamsters the risk is low.&nbsp; I worked at a laboratory where I handled up to 1000 animals.&nbsp; We lab workers were required to wear protection whenever we were in the animals' rooms.&nbsp; Both the workers and animals were tested regularly. <br><br>How do you get LCMV?&nbsp; Well, there are a number of ways to get it.&nbsp; The more common way is through handling an animal that passes the infection through urine to the hand of the human who then either touches his eyes or mouth.&nbsp; Another way is though airborne dust that contains dried urine or feces. <br><br>To avoid problems keep your rodent area clean; bleach and disinfectants kill the virus readily.&nbsp; Change bedding on a regular basis.&nbsp; Wash your hands before and after handling the animals.&nbsp; Don't allow wild animals access to your hamstery. If you are pregnant consult with your vet and doctor about this.&nbsp; It's probably wise to avoid contact with your animals for the duration of your pregnancy.</span></font></td>
