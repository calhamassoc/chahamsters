	<td><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Question:</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>Hello, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would you happen to know what a Copper Teddy Bear would sell for?&nbsp; And we have other rare colors and were just wondering. Could you possibly send a price list of what certain colors are worth in Syrians? And what we should sell them for.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance... Blue roan, Smoke Pearl, Mink, etc.<br><br></span><b><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Answer:</span></font></b><span style="font-size:14"><br>I will give you my philosophy.&nbsp; I view a new or less common color as an opportunity – not to make money but to offer people variety and get them excited about the species.&nbsp; If you have been to my site, you will see that I have documented two new genes in the Campbells.&nbsp; There was only one breeder in Moscow with one of those genes.&nbsp; I do not believe it was anywhere else in the world or that she was going to continue breeding it.&nbsp; I brought it back to the US (at my expense) and have since made it available to everyone.&nbsp; I actually gave a number of them away free to other breeders so that they could play around with the gene.&nbsp; I never charged more for them than the going rate for a common normal Campbells.&nbsp; I saw it as a way to get more fanciers interested in dwarves.&nbsp; I take a fancier’s or hobbyist’s viewpoint.&nbsp; (You can see pictures of these animals at www.geocities.com/AAAHamsters.)<br><br>I have approached the second gene I am documenting (the mock chinchilla or silver gray) in the same manner.&nbsp; I have never charged any more than I do for any other color even though no one else has these animals.&nbsp; On top of that, I have combined colors that no one else in the world has.&nbsp; Again, I do not charge by the number of genes that hamster has or by its supposed “rarity.”&nbsp; I make sure people receive a quality hamster who is friendly, healthy, and will suit their needs.&nbsp; I also make sure I know what it is genetically and do not make up cute names to promote them.<br><br>So you ask about a few colors in particular.&nbsp; First, some of those are very common here.&nbsp; I have them and/or see them all the time in pet stores.&nbsp; If they aren’t as common in your area, you can easily promote them and make them more popular.&nbsp; I would say that the appropriate price is the exact same price that you charge for your other syrians.&nbsp; Why would you charge more?&nbsp; I assume they are equally healthy and friendly as your others.&nbsp; These will make no better and no worse breeders or pets, so you should charge the same.<br><br>I would also think that, as a responsible breeder, you would want to check the genetic make-up of your hamsters to make sure you are providing the appropriate information to your buyers.&nbsp; As best I know, there is no such thing as a “blue” roan.&nbsp; (There is, however, a blue mink roan although I have not heard anyone just call it a &quot;blue&quot; roan.)&nbsp; Yes I know some breeders who use the term &quot;blue&quot; roan.&nbsp; From what they have told me, it is actually a sable roan.&nbsp; A sable roan does have a blue coloration (I’ve bred dozens of them myself) so they use “blue&quot; roan since it is more appealing and makes them sound more exotic.&nbsp; Fine, but please let your buyers know that they are purchasing a sable roan genetically and that you use the nickname “blue&quot; roan since you like it.<br><br>I would certainly make sure you do the same with your other colors.&nbsp; I have some hamsters that I could easily sell to unsuspecting buyers as “copper” hamsters even though they are not genetically copper.&nbsp; Some breeders are even labeling hamsters “copper” even though they are definitely not copper.&nbsp; They don’t even have the right eye color so they clearly are something else entirely.&nbsp; I find that unethical.&nbsp; I always make sure I know and tell them what they are getting – or tell them the research I have done so far on that color if things are not finalized.&nbsp; So please do that before using these terms and promoting your hamsters as “rare.”&nbsp; Hamsters are only “rare” in certain regions.&nbsp; Everything you talk about is easily found in different regions.<br><br>So instead of trying to find out how much you can make off your more unusual colors (at least in your area), I would suggest you look at what opportunities you have to get others excited about hamsters.&nbsp; I have found time and time again that breeders who focus on money make the wrong decisions for the hamsters.&nbsp; So in my opinion you should re-consider the whole assumption behind your question.</span></td>
