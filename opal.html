Wynne-Edwards, a Professor of Biology at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada.&nbsp; Some of you may be familiar with her work as a hamster behavioralist.&nbsp; She is one of the few Western researchers who has been allowed to study the dwarf hamsters in their native habitat.&nbsp; She has also been allowed to bring wild caught hamsters back to the university for further study.&nbsp; The Opal mutation occurred in these wild caught Campbells hamsters.<br><br>She has kindly taken the time to research the events of more than 10 years ago.&nbsp; I started with the information reported by Chris Henwood in 1993 and 1994 in the BHA journals.&nbsp; He stated that the Opal mutation occurred in lab animals and was given to a hamster fancier on the East Coast of the United States by the name of Jim Wildschut.&nbsp; I contacted Jim Wildschut who explained what details he remembered.&nbsp; He was a large dwarf breeder at the time and still maintains a colony of dwarf hamsters.&nbsp; His information confirmed that our animals came from a shipment he made to Southern California.<br><br>Using his information, I contacted Dr. Wynne-Edwards to trace the mutation backwards and get confirmation that the mutation occurred in her lab.&nbsp; She confirmed that her lab is the “spontaneous origin” of the Opal mutation, and this information is documented in her lab notes.<br><br>According to Dr. Wynne-Edwards’ lab notes, on March 28, 1992, she gave Jim Wildschut one male Opal and one female Opal from a litter born on March 7, 1992.&nbsp; She stated that the animals “were of pure P. campbelli stock, derived from animals that I captured in the wild.”&nbsp; She stated that the animals were “of interest to Jim, but not relevant to us.”&nbsp; She further stated that they were “the offspring of two generations of full-sibling matings that were deliberately established to see if the coat colour would remain.”<br><br>As Jim Wildschut stated and Dr. Wynne-Edwards confirmed, her lab is not interested in color mutations.&nbsp; We were lucky, though, that she allowed this mutation to leave the lab and enter the pet market.&nbsp; Many color mutations never leave the lab in which they are discovered.&nbsp; The Opal color and its many color combinations have been a constant in the U.S. Campbells animals for over a decade now.&nbsp; With the scarcity of Winter Whites in general and the virtual non-existence of Sapphire Winter Whites on this continent, the Campbells are overwhelmingly the most commonly owned dwarf hamster in North America.<br><br>We are lucky that Dr. Wynne-Edwards keeps such detailed records, and we are lucky to know so much about the gene mutation.&nbsp; There are few hamster genes about which we have so much information.<br><br>Does this mean that all of the “Opal” animals in Europe are pure Campbells?&nbsp; Obviously this does not prove that.&nbsp; Melissa Chamberlain’s article in the February NHC journal indicates a prevalence of hybrids in Europe.&nbsp; Europeans may have hybridized the Sapphires and created animals which they are calling “Opals.”&nbsp; If indeed they are hybridized Sapphires, though, they should be renamed to reflect their origin.&nbsp; They should not be called Opals, and they should never be used as a justification to claim that the Opal mutation is not a true mutation which occurred spontaneously in pure Campbells dwarf hamsters.<br><br>In America there are still many pure Opals, and we have never seen health problems associated with this mutation.&nbsp; Even when I started raising the Opals a decade ago, we detected no health problems.&nbsp; The animals were of good size and of good health and bred as readily as the Normals of that time.<br><br>To see how the Opal gene affects the coat color on Campbells, you can see a </span><a href="http://www.aaahamsters.org/OpalStd1.html"><span style="font-size:14">picture gallery</span></a><span style="font-size:14"> on the AAA Hamsters site..</span></td>
