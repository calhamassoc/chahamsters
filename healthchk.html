<table width=590 height=1195 border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr valign="top">
	<td><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">Although hamsters are generally very healthy pets, they can and do get sick.&nbsp; Our goal is to minimize the health risks to any hamsters coming to a CHA show.&nbsp; Thus, we perform health checks on all hamsters which come to our shows.&nbsp; Our goal is to ensure that all hamsters are healthy enough to be shown and that they will not infect any other hamsters.<br><br>Each animal will be picked up and examined in turn.&nbsp; The fur, skin, eyes, ears, etc. will be examined by the designated health checker.&nbsp; If any problems are found, the health checker determines the significance of the problem to both that hamster and to the other hamsters entered in the show.&nbsp; Health checkers use a disinfectant on their hands before handling animals in each cage.&nbsp; (The judge will also a disinfectant between each animal judged.)<br><br>All decisions are solely at the discretion of the health checker, but the health checker will typically ask for a second opinion before removing a hamster from the day’s judging.&nbsp; Note that the judge may also remove any hamster during the judging process if a problem is found.<br><br>Let’s take a few examples of things we look for and how we might deal with them at a CHA show.</span></font><span style="font-size:14"><br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">1. Wounds.</span></b><span style="font-size:14">  If the wound is open, that hamster will typically be removed from judging, but there will be no impact to cagemates or other animals since it would not be contagious.<br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">2. Scabs.</span></b><span style="font-size:14">  Again, since a scab is not contagious, there will be no impact to cagemates or other animals at the show.&nbsp; Depending on the judgement of the health checker, though, this hamster may or may not be allowed to remain in the judging.&nbsp; Factors will typically include the size and location of the scab, the apparent newness of the wound, etc.&nbsp; If the health checker feels the stress will negatively impact the hamster, he will be removed from judging.&nbsp; This is entirely at the discretion of the health checker.&nbsp; Note that if such a hamster is allowed to be judged, it may also lose points during the judging for the scab.<br></span><b><span style="font-size:14"><br>3. Mites.</span></b><span style="font-size:14">  Some mites are visible to the naked eye.&nbsp; Although rarely found at shows, one of these mites is common in California.&nbsp; It’s the tropical rat mite, and it likes hamsters.&nbsp; If this mite is found on a hamster, that hamster and any cagemates will be disqualified.&nbsp; Since these mites are very mobile, any such hamsters and cagemates will be removed entirely from the judging area and be isolated. <br></span><b><span style="font-size:14"><br>4. Tumors.</span></b><span style="font-size:14">  Periodically a tumor will be found on a hamster at a show.&nbsp; This would not be contagious, so the cagemates and other hamsters at the show would not be at risk.&nbsp; The hamster would most likely be removed from judging, however.<br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">5. Wet tail (syrians only).</span></b><span style="font-size:14">  This is a contagious disease which affects syrians and typically leads to death if not treated.&nbsp; Luckily, we have never seen this at a show nor do I know of any members who have had this in recent years.&nbsp; In our area, it is most common to contract this disease when obtaining a hamster from a pet store.&nbsp; (This reinforces the need to quarantine all new animals – meaning that they are maintained entirely separately from your other hamsters and should never be brought to shows within 30 days of purchase.)&nbsp; If this disease were found in a hamster at a show, it would certainly be removed and serious discussions would ensue with the owner to discover the actions needed both to treat his/her hamsters and to understand what might need to be done to other syrians at the show.<br></span><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18"><br>What can you do to help prevent bringing a sick hamster?&nbsp; The most important single thing is to quarantine all hamsters you receive from any source.&nbsp; If you purchase a new hamster from a pet store, accept a rescue, or even if you buy from a breeder, quarantine the new animal(s) from your other animals.&nbsp; Since the incubation for most diseases is under two weeks, follow this process for at least two weeks.&nbsp; Do all feedings and cage cleanings on the new hamsters last.&nbsp; Watch and observe them carefully.&nbsp; And don’t take them to a show unless you have had them for at least two weeks and observed no signs of any problems whatsoever.&nbsp; If you even suspect that there may possibly be a problem, do not bring your animals to the show and don’t touch anyone else’s animals at that show.<br><br>After the show, you should again quarantine any animals that you had at the show for two weeks.&nbsp; Although we do our best to detect and isolate any potential problems at the shows, we cannot ensure the health of all animals which people bring.&nbsp; Thus, it is in your best interest to quarantine all animals you’ve brought to the show to prevent any potential disease from infecting your other animals.</span></font></td>
