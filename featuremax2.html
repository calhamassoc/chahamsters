	<td><span style="font-size:14">The healthiest food for a diabetic is vegetables. I feed up to 50% of their daily volume as fresh veggies. Of course, you have to arrive at this quantity very gradually, but now all my hams enjoy a similar fresh-based diet, and with no diarrhea from it. Protein is also important. I feed about 18% of daily caloric intake as protein to mine until they pass 12-15 months of age, and then gradually decrease it to avoid exacerbating any amyloidosis as their kidney function declines with age. Protein-rich foods healthful for all hamsters include steamed chicken, tofu, lentils, fat-free cottage cheese, fat-free unsweetened yogurt, unsweetened soymilk and some kitten milk replacement formulas. Some people use goat's milk, but I couldn't find it.<br> <br>Diabetics have viscous blood and decreased circulation, so while all hamsters require a low-fat diet for their cardio- and cerebrovascular health and to prevent the heart attacks and strokes that are too common among them, it is critical for diabetics. To reduce fat, I remove the sunflower seeds and any nuts or other fatty seeds from commercial mixes, and avoid saturated fats and cholesterol.<br> <br>Max's diabetes was very severe, and while we managed to cut his urine glucose readings by 50%, they were still ten times high normal.&nbsp; He often had times when he metabolized so little of his food he'd become too weak even to eat. I hand-fed him rice and bits of chicken, broccoli, spinach -- all his favorites, and kept him drinking when he was reluctant. Eventually, he drank up to three times his body weight daily, so I reduced his protein intake to help his strained kidneys. We spent many nights cuddled in a warm sweater, nibbling rice and sharing smoochies.<br> <br>Puppy and a third diabetic, Bug, are doing wonderfully on this plan. Puppy survived pneumonia in April, which an amazed vet called a miracle. Nothing ever helped Max enough, and his struggle ended peacefully in June.&nbsp; <br> <br>But when he felt good, there never was a happier hamster.<br><br></span><b><span style="font-size:14">Note:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-size:14">If you have further questions about diabetes, you may e-mail Jane at janelandis@earthlink.net<br><br>Jane has also started a yahoogroups list for focused discussions on diabetes in hamsters.&nbsp; The list deals with diagnosing diabetes and learning to best treat diabetes.&nbsp; The list includes many people who currently have or have had diabetic hamsters as well as those who just want to understand the disease.&nbsp; Breeders are also encouraged to join so that they know what to look for in their animals.&nbsp; To join the list, send an e-mail to<br></span><font size="+1"><span style="font-size:18">HoneyHams-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</span></font></td>
